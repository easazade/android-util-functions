***document will be added soon***
  
<p>this is a library containing utility functions (many of them kotlin extension functions) and helper  
classes that I use in my apps. now they are all in one library so that i don't have to search  
older projects and copy paste them one by one</p>


```groovy
//add this to your project build
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
```kotlin
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.easazade:android-util-functions:$last_version'
}
```
